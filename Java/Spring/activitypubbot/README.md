# Java / Sprin Boot ActivityPub Bot 

The status of this code is that it implements a basic service where via a web
UI you can create "bot" profiles which other ActivityPub instances can
successfully look up.

The next step would be to implment follows. Followed by posts. So then you'd
have a bot that people can follow and it can post things that those people then
see.

However at this point this project is shifted to the back-burner as it has
fulfilled it's short-term purpose (a quick Java refresher and getting an idea
of what Spring Boot is and does) and I now need to focus my time on other
things.
