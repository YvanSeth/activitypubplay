# activitypubplay

Yvan's basic ActivityPub implementations in (eventually) various languages. The
simple project spec is to build an implementation that provides the ability to
to create "bot" accounts that can be followed and post messages, receiving
replies as perhaps a stretch-goal.

I make no claims to be an expert in any programming language used here, these
are not intended to be definitive expert quality coding examples. They are in
fact primarily a learning experience for myself and feedback is thus very
welcome! (I'm using GitHub as I also need to get myself proficient with
git!)

## Java / Spring Boot

    Java/Spring/activitypubbot

An implementation using the
[Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/index.html "Spring Boot")
framework trying to refresh and educate myself in some styles of MVC and DAO
pattern type web application implementations as well as remember Java itself! A
language I have only used very lightly in the last 20 years, though I learnt it
and even taught using it back in Uni. (A very long time ago...)

## Go

I was originally going to write AP bot code in Go, but then I got distracted
by:

## PHP / Laravel

I made a start on the Laravel framework, but then I got distracted by Java /
Spring Boot!

I hope to return to one of the above once I'm happy enough with the base level
Java implementation... or maybe I'll get distracted by a whole other option.
(Rust is seeming interesting actually.)
