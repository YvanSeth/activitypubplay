# activitypubplay
Yvan's basic ActivityPub implementations in various languages. The project is
to build an implementation that provides the ability to do nothing more than
create "bots" and post messages as those bots.  I've made sarts in Go and PHP
which I'll push into here in time, but this repo was created with a Java
implementation as the first project.

I claim to be no expert in any programming language, these are not intended to
be definitive expert quality coding examples. They are in fact a learning
experience for myself and feedback is thus very welcome!

## Java / Spring Boot

    Java/Spring/activitypubbot

An implementation using the
[Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/index.html "Spring Boot")
framework trying to refresh and educate myself in some styles of MVC
and DAO pattern type web application implementations as well as remember
Java itself! A language I have only used very lightly in the last
20 years, though I learnt it and even taught using it back in Uni.
(A very long time ago...)

## Go

Actually the first implementation I started but not got too far yet, hopefully
to upload in time. Not got as far as picking a web framework for this.

## PHP / Laravel

My second implementation but also not got too far with it yet, going with
Laravel as it was specified in a job role I was applying for but that blanked
out so I moved on with the Java one as higher priority.
